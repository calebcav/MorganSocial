## Overview
### Description
Morgan Social is an app strictly for Morgan State Students that provides news, events, opinions on certain matters, clubs/orgs, meeting other students, etc. What's great about this app is that everything is ran by the students! Everything about how people feel about food, dorms, professors, and the overall Morgan experience would be expressed by the students. I feel like as a student, I would much rather hear from another student about how they feel about a school than someone who was hired to say only positive things (pew pew pew shots fired). The good thing about this is that you can showcase your small business, you can create an unofficial club, etc.
